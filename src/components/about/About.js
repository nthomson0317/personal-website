                        <p> My name is NICHOLAS THOMSON I am a full-stack software engineer and Technical Writer at Datadog. My transition to tech began during the pandemic, when I left my job as an Assistant Editor at Alfred A. Knopf, where I worked with luminary authors such as Henry Louis Gates Jr., Fernando Aramburu, Giulio Boccaletti, and Kent Russell. All my life I have studied languages, including French, Russian, Attic Greek, and the memories of hours spent poring over foreign dictionaries first led me to programming. Once I began learning to code, I discovered that this field of inquiry called upon similar skills to those I had developed over the years as an enthusiastic patzer at the chess board. Every day, Iâ€™m learning more, and I am excited to create appealing, interactive worlds within the browser.   </p>
